## Here's what I'm up to today.

1. Studying python
2. Alerts as code! Continuing my work on templatizing alerts and dashboards in Terraform, using the [Wavefront TF provider integration](https://docs.wavefront.com/wavefront-terraform-provider.html). Creating a framework to programmatically manage all of my team's active alerts and dashboards in Wavefront using Terraform.
3. Making small tweaks to this Hugo site. 
    - to-do list includes:
        - add an "about me" & skills section
        - configure the infrastructure in terraform (s3 buckets, route53 dns assignments, cloudfront distribution)
        - set up ci/cd pipeline using codeship for automatic deployments
