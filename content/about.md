Hi, I'm Eric Fuerstenberg.

I'm an operations engineer with a broad base of experience in public cloud (primarily AWS), site reliability, and crafting automation to defeat toil. 

I use a variety of tools in my day to day. Here's a short list:

- AWS (IAM, EC2, S3, CloudWatch, CloudTrail)
- Linux, LDAP, Django, Python
- Wavefront, Splunk, Kibana
- Terraform, Puppet, Codeship, git

Most recently, my interests have shifted toward mastering infrastructure-as-code and cloud based solutions for building and maintaining highly scalable and highly available services. 

If that sounds like your cup of tea, I have a few projects on GitHub that may be of interest.
