Hi, I'm Eric Fuerstenberg.

I'm a site reliability engineer with a broad base of experience in public cloud (primarily AWS and GCP).

I use a variety of tools in my day to day. Here's a short list:

- AWS (IAM, EC2, S3, DynamoDB, EventBridge, CloudWatch, SNS/SQS)
- Linux, Python, boto3 SDK, aws cli, gcloud, Docker, LDAP
- Wavefront, Splunk, Kibana
- Terraform/Terragrunt, Puppet, Jenkins, git

Most recently, my interests have shifted toward mastering infrastructure-as-code and cloud based solutions for building and maintaining highly scalable and highly available services. 

If that sounds like your cup of tea, I have a few projects on GitHub that may be of interest.
